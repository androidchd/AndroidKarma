<p style="float:left;width: 100%; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:14px; line-height:25px;">In an endeavour to promote organic living, Karma Lakelands has set up a Herb & Vegetable garden with the Agro Initiative, along with a mini dairy farm with cows & free range chickens within the premises. Working in tandem with the setting up of an in-house nursery, the initiative extends to the improvement of our fruit orchards and kitchen gardens. In addition to this, is our Bee Farming initiative. As a source of organic local honey and nutritious Bee Pollen for residents, it is a tastier and healthier alternative because it is replete with pollen, enzymes and nutrients that can be lost in pasteurization. </p>

<p style="float:right;width: 100%; margin:0; font-size:14px; line-height:25px;">The idea and inspiration behind this set-up is to create a self-sustaining community of health and wellbeing.</p>

<p style="float:left;width: 100%; font-size:14px; line-height:25px;">The honey is not for sale, but supports in funding the Karma Day Care facility. It is available in the pro-shop and the contributions raised in lieu of our organic produce are used to assist the children in their education and nurture. Please feel free to contact the staff to visit the day care or the bee farming gardens.</p>
