<p style="float:left;width: 100%; font-size:14px; line-height:25px;">Away from the shackles of urban concrete jungles, we created a dreamscape of perfect living. To relook, rethink and rediscover a life that is not restrained by walls and suffocated by boundaries.</br>  Karma Lakelands has created an oasis of serenity and greenery. Trees have been planted, water bodies, meadows and lawns have been created to give birth to a haven for you and your family</p>

<p style="float:right;width: 100%; font-size:14px; line-height:25px;">At Karma, you experience only tree top level development and the entire campus is a No Horn Zone. Here, all rain water is harvested and we have created an area for bio composting of all kitchen and green waste. Furthermore, our organic, agro and bee farming initiatives bring you closer to nature. 
This is your chance to cultivate, capture and cherish the pleasure of being down to earth. Seize it.
